This editor extension for Unity compress a RGBA 32bit image into a RGB565 16bit format image, by using chroma subsampling and dithering technique.
With cutting down the memory usage by 50%, this algorithm reduces the color banding.

## Result
![Example](https://github.com/taqu/YUVDither/blob/master/result.png)
